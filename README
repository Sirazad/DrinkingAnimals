ANIMALS: 
The Zoo has various animals. All of them can make sounds, which differ.  
Create at least 3 different animals.
Animals need to drink, and can only drink from Waterbuckets. Animals keep track of the water they drank. 
Drinking makes them happy, they express it with sounds and note the amount of water they drank.
Make them be resilient at a different level, so there are animals which are more resilient, animals, which are less resilient.

WATERSOURCE:
Animals can only drink from WaterBuckets. 
Create an interface called WaterbucketProvider. if a class implements this interface it must has a method wich returns a waterbucket.
There are two places where Waterbuckets can be picked up implement classes for them:
    -Zoo: it gives waterbucket filled with 1-5 liters of water with a 25 percent chance that the water is dirty.
    -Fountain: it gives waterbucket filled with 1-3 liters of water with a 50 percent chance that the water is dirty.


DIRTY WATER
if an animal drinks from a bucket that contains dirty water, they get sick. 
If you attempt to make a sick animal drink dirty water again, they complain and rejectWater.

DATABASE
create a database/structure for keeping tack of animals and water supply
create a DAO system for JDBC and FILE to connect to the information needed
fill things with data and use it

INTRODUCE TIME
Time passes and that means, animals need to drink, water will refill, and the sick heal. 
Create a way to represent the passage of time. 
Make it a parameter given for the simulation. 
Any animal, that can not drink within a given set of days, will get seriously sick and need medical attention.
